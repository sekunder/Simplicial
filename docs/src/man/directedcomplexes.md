# Directed Complexes

A *directed complex* ``(V, D)`` is a finite set ``V``, called the *vertex set*,
together with a collection ``D`` of "proper sequences" on ``V``, closed under
taking subsequences. A "proper sequence" is a a sequence ``(v_1,v_2,\dots,v_k)``
with ``v_i \in V`` and no ``v_i``s repeated. The closure property says that if
``s = (v_1,\dots,v_k) \in D``, then every subsequence of ``s`` is also in ``D``.
